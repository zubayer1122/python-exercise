# Logical Operators
# x = 5
# print(x < 3 and x < 10)
# print(not(x < 3 or x > 10))
# print(x < 6 or x > 6)

#  Identity Operators
# x = ["apple", "banana"]
# y = ["apple", "banana"]
# z = x
# print(x is z)
# print(x is not y)
# print(x == y)

# x = ["apple", "Banana"]
# print("banana" in x)

# x = ["apple", "banana"]
# print("iphone 16pro max" not in x)

# If ... Else
# If statement:
# a = 33
# b = 330
# if b > a:
#  print("b is greater than a")

# The elif keyword
# a = 33
# b = 3
# if b > a:
#  print("b is greater than a")
# elif a == b:
#  print("a and b are equal")
# elif b < a:
#  print("a is greater than b")

# a = 200
# b = 33
# if b > a:
#  print("b is greater than a")
# elif a == b:
#  print("a and b are equal")
# else:
#  print("a is greater than b")

# And
# The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional
# statements:
# a = 200
# b = 33
# c = 500
# if a > b and c > a:
#  print("Both conditions are True")

 
# a = 200
# b = 33
# c = 500
# if a > b or a > c:
#  print("At least one of the conditions is True")

# Test if a is NOT greater than b
# a = 33
# b = 200
# if not a > b:
#  print("a is NOT greater than b")

# Nested If
# x = 11
# if x > 10:
#  print("Above ten,")
#  if x > 20:
#    print("and also above 20!")
#  else:
#    print("but not above 20.")

# The pass Statement
# a = 33
# b = 200
# if b > a:
#   pass

# x = 0

# while x < 6:
#     print(x)
#     x += 1

# x = 0

# while x < 6:
#     print(x,"zubayer vhai")
#     x += 1
